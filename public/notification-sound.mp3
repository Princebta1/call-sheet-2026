This file should be replaced with an actual notification sound MP3 file.
You can use a free notification sound from sources like:
- https://notificationsounds.com/
- https://freesound.org/
- Create your own using audio editing software

The file should be:
- Short (1-2 seconds)
- Pleasant and not jarring
- Clear but not too loud
- In MP3 format for broad browser compatibility

Recommended: A soft "ding" or "pop" sound at moderate volume.
